# Android performance reports

In the launcher, open Settings, enable **Performance recording**, then press
Play. Reproduce the slow startup, travel or other problem during normal play.
Return to the launcher and select **Performance report → Save latest to
Downloads**. Send the `.jsonl` file from **Download/HorizonAndroid**.

Recording is off by default. Each run is limited to 30 minutes and 8 MiB; the
three latest internal reports are retained. Exported copies remain in Downloads.
Reports are written on a bounded background queue and flushed once per sample;
if Android kills the process, completed samples remain available on next launch.
Storage permission is needed to export on Android 8.1/9, but not Android 10+.

The report contains:

- One-second frame/CPU/GPU summaries with percentiles, maxima and slow events.
- Named render/server CPU spans: elapsed and thread CPU time, counts and maxima.
- Worker tasks: saved-chunk loading, generation, decoration, lighting, meshing
  and saving; concurrent task totals are reported separately from frame timings.
- Streaming queues, dirty light, pending mesh uploads and cumulative upload bytes.
- Terrain draw calls, resident sections, GPU allocation counters where available,
  resolution, render/simulation distances, presentation mode and effective FPS cap.
- Focus/pause/idle state, underwater state and entity/particle counts.
- Android power-saving mode and reported thermal status (Android 10+), without
  root or access to device identifiers. A thermal status of 0 means none, 1 light,
  2 moderate, 3 severe, 4 critical, 5 emergency, 6 shutdown; unavailable is null.

These identify expensive stages and correlate spikes with background work. Nested
spans overlap and must not be added together. Wall time exceeding thread CPU time
can mean scheduling or waiting; it does not prove a particular lock is responsible.
GPU timing is asynchronous and can be missing; this is not a per-shader GPU profiler.
Recording itself adds timing overhead, so compare benchmark runs with recording off.

There is no automatic upload. Reports do not include account tokens, nicknames,
chat, server addresses, world names, seeds or player coordinates.

Developer regression check: `python tools/test_android_performance.py`. It runs
the actual recorder/statistics/timing code in a host harness and substitutes only
Android publication. Android MediaStore export still requires a device check.
